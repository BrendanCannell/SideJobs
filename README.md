# SideJobs
SideJobs Project 3

Purpose:
Sidejobs is a full-stack app which is focused on offering services with ratings. Users will be able to both post services with per hour cost, as well as respond to service posts with an internal chat system. This is useful because common sites/apps like craigslist offer services, but don't allow users to rate the services. This adds that additional functionality which gives services more credibility and public trust.
