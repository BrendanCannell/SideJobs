# SideJobs
SideJobs Project 3

Purpose:
Sidejobs is a full-stack app which is focused on offering services with ratings. Users will be able to both post services with per hour cost, as well as respond to service posts with an internal chat system. 

Stage I(MVC):
Users are able to login and post a service with their email address. Users are able to make multiple posts with different services.

Stage II:
Users must make a login in order to respond to posts. (Information is hidden to non-users). Mobile responsiveness begins. Users are able to search by multiple parameters. Comments are able to be posted unique to user with the form of first name and first letter of last name.

Stage III:
Users use an internal chat system to contact posters of services. Services are able to be rated by user on a scale of 1-5.

Stage IV:
Chat system extends to mobile.

Stage V:
Unique profiles are created for posters. Users are able to rate profiles as well as individual services.
